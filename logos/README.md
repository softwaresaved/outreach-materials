# Software Sustainability Institute logos 
There are two different designs of the Institute’s logo. The main logo contains the Institute’s exploded doughnut design and the full name of the Institute:

The second design contains only the exploded doughnut and the web address, as such it is smaller than the main logo and can be used when space is premium:

The former should be used in preference to the latter.

The Software Sustainability Institute logo must only be used as a single graphical unit. It *must not be adapted, re-coloured, or modified* in any way other than uniformly re-scaling the logo to fit the intended usage.

Two official logo “colours” are  available: a full-colour version for use on white and light-coloured backgrounds, and a white version for use on dark backgrounds.

We also have a black version for use on white backgrounds and only when black and white printing is allowed. *The black version should not be chosen over the full-colour version.*

Any questions about the use of our logo should be directed to [info@software.ac.uk](info@software.ac.uk)
