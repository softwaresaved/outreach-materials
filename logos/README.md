<h2>Logo Guidance</h2>

<h3>Colour</h3>

<p>Please do not change the SSI logos or alter them in anyway. Always use the files provided. Always use the red coloured logo whenever possible. Use the black or white versions whenever red cannot be used.</p>

<h3>Exclusion Zone</h3>

<p>To preserve the clarity and legibility of the SSI logos, the height of the text should be used as illustrated to create a safe area. No other text or images should enter this space. This ensures that the logo has clarity and legibility.</p>

<h3>Integrity</h3>

<p>Modifying and editing the logo in any way undermines its impact and the professionalism of the SSI producing communications that wonâ€™t represent the brand correctly.&nbsp;Do not tilt, apply effects, alter proportions, alter the typeface, alter the hierarchy, or place on low contrasting backgrounds.</p>
